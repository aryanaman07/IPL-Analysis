# IPL-Analysis


# **🏏 IPL Data Analysis**  

## **📌 Introduction**  
This project is based on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset.  
Using real IPL match data, this analysis provides insights into player performance, match trends, venue impact, and much more.  

---

## **📌 Project Description**  
The objective of this project is to:  
- **Explore and analyze IPL data** to understand match dynamics, player performances, and game trends.  
- **Address key questions** about batting, bowling, captaincy, stadium trends, and super over matches.  
- **Perform in-depth EDA** and visualize insights using Python.  

---

## **📌 Data Sources**  
- The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and is **publicly accessible**.  
- **Minimal preprocessing** was performed, focusing on:  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Standardizing team and player names  
  - Ensuring compatibility between match and delivery datasets  
- **All dataset files** are included within this project repository.  

### 📂 The dataset consists of two files:  
1️⃣ **`matches.csv`** – Contains IPL match details (season, teams, results, captains, umpires, etc.).  
2️⃣ **`deliveries.csv`** – Provides ball-by-ball details of IPL matches (batsman, bowler, runs, wickets, etc.).

## **📌 Tools Used**  
This project leverages **Python** for data analysis, implementing **essential concepts** such as data transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization.  

🔧 **Utilized Python libraries:**  
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `NumPy` – Numerical operations  
- `Matplotlib` – Data visualization  
- `Seaborn` – Statistical plotting
